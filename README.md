# How to Clone a GitHub Repository, Make Changes, and Submit a Pull Request

Follow these steps to contribute to a GitHub project:

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **"Code"** button and copy the HTTPS or SSH URL.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the cloned repository.
5. Execute the clone command:

```bash
git clone [repository_URL]
```

Replace `[repository_URL]` with the copied URL.

---

### 2. Create a New Branch

1. Navigate into the cloned repository directory:

```bash
cd [repository_name]
```

2. Create and switch to a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b [your-branch-name]
```

Choose a descriptive name for your branch that reflects the changes you'll make.

---

### 3. Make Changes

1. Open the repository in your preferred code editor.
2. Make the desired modifications to the files.

---

### 4. Stage and Commit Changes

1. Stage your changes:

```bash
git add .
```

This stages all modified and new files.  
Alternatively, you can stage specific files by replacing `.` with the file path.

2. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Descriptive message about your changes"
```

---

### 5. Push Changes to GitHub

Push your new branch and its commits to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git push origin [your-branch-name]
```

---

### 6. Create a Pull Request

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub in your web browser.
2. GitHub will likely display a banner indicating recent pushes to your branch and a **"Compare & pull request"** button. Click it.
3. Alternatively, go to the **"Pull requests"** tab and click **"New pull request"**.
4. Select:
   - **Base branch:** the branch you want to merge into (typically `main` or `master`)
   - **Compare branch:** your new branch with the changes
5. Provide a clear title and description for your pull request, explaining the changes and why they are necessary.
6. Click **"Create pull request"** (or **"Create draft pull request"** if you're not ready for review).
